00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:28.749
Alright man, I'm outta here, I'll catch you later!

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:29.769
Alright man, I'm outta here, I'll catch you later!
[Evan grunts]

00:00:39.959 --> 00:00:42.529
[chemistry lab chatter]

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.989
Is this taken?

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:14.489
Where are my manners?

00:01:14.489 --> 00:01:15.799
I'm Martin.

00:01:16.019 --> 00:01:17.179
I'm Bertha.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.199
Damn. Those notes are so neat!

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:27.259
Neat? I have more flowers in this thing than actual notes.

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.039
I mean, your drawings are better than my chicken scratch.

00:01:31.629 --> 00:01:33.269
[Bertha laughs]

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:40.359
So... what's your major?

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.439
Nuclear engineering, and you?

00:01:43.779 --> 00:01:46.059
Nice! I didn't know we had that program.

00:01:46.059 --> 00:01:47.419
I'm pre-health.

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:50.099
No shit! I almost
came in on that.

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:53.339
What made you change your mind?

00:01:53.519 --> 00:01:56.879
Well, the thought of having to apply to another school...

00:01:56.879 --> 00:01:59.179
You know, once is good 
enough for me.

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:01.179
Yeah, don't even remind me.

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.109
I'm trying not to think about that for another couple years.

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.619
Alright class, how's everyone doing this beautiful morning, huh?

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:11.839
Huh?

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.809
[Georgia Tech steam whistle]

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.609
Alright, alright, 
glad to hear it,

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:19.209
but just settle down now.

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.779
Anyways, I'm Ben, and I'll be your lab assistant for the semester.

00:02:23.919 --> 00:02:27.189
Few things about myself, I'm a third-year ChemE,

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:28.289
don't mean to brag...

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.789
And this is my first semester working as an L.A.

00:02:31.969 --> 00:02:35.609
So, I'm here to help anyone and everyone with, you know,

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:39.039
experiments and such, but
most importantly,

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:43.279
I'm here to make sure that no one leaves with less body parts than they came in with.

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.219
Alright!

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.619
So... let's review that syllabus and get started!

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:56.489
[Martin] So, do you see something in that fourth one?

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:57.559
What do you see?

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.789
[Bertha] Uh, there's like a few lumps at the bottom of it.

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.369
So what do you want to
call that color?

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.469
It's like a cloudy
whiteish color.

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:09.659
Well, that eliminates these...

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.379
Want to call it...
silver nitrate?

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.969
Yeah!

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.029
[stammering]
Yeah, sure, that makes sense.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.739
Nice.

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:23.519
Alright! What's next?

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:29.689
All we have to do now is draw a few Bohr models for the precipitates.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:31.829
Cool. Let's get that
done quickly.

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.809
Hey, can I borrow your
periodic table?

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.279
[Bertha] Yeah.
[Martin] I can't find
mine anywhere.

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:47.909
Yeah. I'll put it right here,

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:51.189
and do consider organizing
that bird nest.

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.549
[Martin laughs awkwardly]

00:03:58.369 --> 00:04:01.509
[foreboding sound effect]

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:16.609
[Bertha] Alright...

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.089
Bye!

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.839
See ya.

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:23.119
See ya.

00:04:43.679 --> 00:04:45.929
[Mysterious music]

00:05:27.139 --> 00:05:29.119
[Bertha] Okay, that's one...

00:05:29.119 --> 00:05:33.309
this one's absorbance is 1.176.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:37.889
[Martin] Great, so we can finally get out of here.

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:38.719
[Bertha] Yeah!

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:42.799
Tell me about it. I am running late for office hours.

00:05:42.799 --> 00:05:43.569
What class?

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:45.679
Calc 2, with Dr. Daniel.

00:05:45.959 --> 00:05:46.809
Lucky.

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:48.389
I got stuck with Dr. Kim.

00:05:48.599 --> 00:05:51.329
Do you know anything about integration by parts?

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.429
Nope, but I hopefully
will by the exam.

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:57.059
I mean, it also
doesn't help that

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:59.749
we have to spend so much time
on these lab reports.

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:00.869
I...

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:03.729
I literally spent three
hours on the last one.

00:06:04.109 --> 00:06:07.619
Who is their right mind wants
an <i>essay</i> for each lab?

00:06:07.619 --> 00:06:08.779
I know, I know, right?

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:11.799
And the audacity for them to dock five points for sig figs!

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.919
[Bertha] Okay, umm...

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:23.439
Hey, if you're not doing anything later,

00:06:23.439 --> 00:06:25.829
do you want to work on our report together?

00:06:27.169 --> 00:06:28.889
Yeah! Yeah, sure!

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:30.619
What time were you thinking?

00:06:31.069 --> 00:06:32.979
Does 7 work for you?

00:06:33.399 --> 00:06:35.759
[stammering] Yeah! Yeah, 7!

00:06:35.799 --> 00:06:38.099
Nice! Yeah, cool. Sounds good.

00:06:38.619 --> 00:06:41.229
[stammering]
Did you just want to
meet at my dorm?

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:43.119
Dorm, to... study?

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:44.809
[Bertha] Yeah. Yeah.

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:46.449
That sounds good.

00:06:46.709 --> 00:06:50.009
I do have to get going though, but I will see you at 7.

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:50.939
[Martin] Cool.
[Bertha] Alright.

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:53.739
See ya.

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:07.019
And then I said,

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:10.089
"Fire a yolk? I thought you
said 'fire a yoke!'"

00:07:11.929 --> 00:07:15.199
Anyways, the horse is dead.

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:17.159
[Bertha] Okay...

00:07:20.489 --> 00:07:21.869
Uh, it's 9.

00:07:22.359 --> 00:07:24.459
Right, we should probably...

00:07:29.399 --> 00:07:31.819
Hey, does this look
weird to you?

00:07:31.819 --> 00:07:34.869
[Bertha] Is this another one of your genius solutions to nuclear fusion?

00:07:34.869 --> 00:07:36.539
No, no, no.

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:40.259
Are you sure this doesn't look... weird to you?

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.089
It looks like a normal
periodic table.

00:07:42.099 --> 00:07:43.049
Same as mine.

00:07:44.489 --> 00:07:46.789
So there's nothing
wrong about this?

00:07:50.919 --> 00:07:54.539
I think we could do without the giant gap in the middle.

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:57.699
You're right! You're right.

00:08:08.339 --> 00:08:09.679
[banging on keyboard]

00:08:13.919 --> 00:08:15.369
That thing still giving
you problems?

00:08:16.389 --> 00:08:20.069
Yeah, this thing's about as useful as a single-stage distillation column,

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:23.539
but Dr. Lombard still expects me to take attendance on it.

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:27.899
Oh! Speaking of that, Bertha was at a tennis match today.

00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:30.009
Yeah, she told me. Just make sure you both have

00:08:30.009 --> 00:08:31.769
your reports submitted
by Wednesday.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:33.689
Thanks a million, man.

00:08:39.219 --> 00:08:40.799
Hey, Ben...

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:44.019
I got a quick question for you.

00:08:44.139 --> 00:08:45.599
Lay it on me, man.

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:51.509
Does that poster seem
wrong to you?

00:08:54.079 --> 00:08:56.009
The periodic table?

00:08:56.449 --> 00:08:57.329
[Martin] Yeah.

00:08:57.819 --> 00:09:00.679
Does it... does it
seem wrong to you?

00:09:01.019 --> 00:09:02.839
What do you mean, exactly?

00:09:03.039 --> 00:09:06.719
Like those are all fake, right?

00:09:07.249 --> 00:09:09.149
Like, they're not real?

00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:14.699
I get they can seem a bit
wonky at first, but...

00:09:14.869 --> 00:09:17.159
...dude, that's just the same old periodic table.

00:09:17.159 --> 00:09:20.679
Okay, if that's so...
if it's normal...

00:09:21.189 --> 00:09:22.489
Please enlighten me.

00:09:23.929 --> 00:09:25.569
How are there negative masses?

00:09:25.569 --> 00:09:28.249
I got a professor doing some exotic matter research,

00:09:28.249 --> 00:09:29.459
probably involved in
something like that...

00:09:29.459 --> 00:09:31.219
[Martin] But when were
they even discovered?

00:09:31.219 --> 00:09:33.539
[Ben] I can imagine in the
last 100 years or so.

00:09:33.569 --> 00:09:36.239
Why are there more elements than there were last week?

00:09:36.289 --> 00:09:38.399
There have always been 224.

00:09:38.499 --> 00:09:40.139
What the fuck is the
Ignotide series?

00:09:40.139 --> 00:09:42.329
I don't fuckin' know, probably some rare earth elements?

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:43.399
[Martin] That's it.

00:09:43.489 --> 00:09:44.978
I've lost my mind,
I'm going insane!

00:09:46.418 --> 00:09:47.438
Oh my gosh!

00:09:47.488 --> 00:09:50.428
I finally huffed enough fumes to send me to the next dimension.

00:09:50.448 --> 00:09:52.898
This shit has been happening
for the past week!

00:09:53.798 --> 00:09:54.508
Look.

00:09:54.948 --> 00:09:59.118
Everything here is real; something we can actually
find, right?

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:02.958
Everything else is a part of some stupid fucking prank

00:10:02.958 --> 00:10:04.908
that's been going on
for way too long,

00:10:04.908 --> 00:10:06.878
and if this is that, spare me

00:10:06.878 --> 00:10:08.658
from this low grade torment

00:10:08.658 --> 00:10:11.538
sustained by a fucking piece
of laminated paper!

00:10:15.558 --> 00:10:18.048
I don't know what to
tell you, man.

00:10:19.728 --> 00:10:21.838
It's just always been this way.

00:10:23.298 --> 00:10:24.498
Yeah.

00:10:26.278 --> 00:10:27.238
Sure.

00:10:28.758 --> 00:10:31.508
Look, I can tell you've
got a lot on your mind.

00:10:31.968 --> 00:10:34.568
Why don't you just go
and get some rest?

00:10:35.368 --> 00:10:38.028
Yeah. You know, maybe
that's right.

00:10:38.038 --> 00:10:40.098
Maybe I just have too much
on my mind right now.

00:10:40.558 --> 00:10:42.128
Don't even worry
about the deadline.

00:10:42.408 --> 00:10:44.858
I'm sure I can get Dr. Lombard to cut you some slack,

00:10:44.858 --> 00:10:47.888
but just go! Get your
mind off things.

00:10:48.988 --> 00:10:49.748
Thanks.

00:11:10.548 --> 00:11:12.028
[Evan] Hey man, I'm back.

00:11:12.248 --> 00:11:13.388
[Martin] Hey man, what's up?

00:11:13.968 --> 00:11:16.088
Just been at the
library all day.

00:11:16.138 --> 00:11:18.838
Got that psychology test
tomorrow and all.

00:11:19.838 --> 00:11:22.158
Oh shit, man, how'd this happen?

00:11:22.578 --> 00:11:25.198
I don't know.
Something must have

00:11:25.208 --> 00:11:27.988
spilled under my glove
at the lab.

00:11:28.608 --> 00:11:29.668
Yeah, I don't know.

00:11:30.138 --> 00:11:33.478
Damn, so much for that safety
gear they give everyone.

00:11:36.198 --> 00:11:38.178
Keep that wrapped up well, man.

00:12:12.188 --> 00:12:16.368
[Martin vomiting]

00:12:18.588 --> 00:12:20.618
[Evan] Come on, let's get
you cleaned up, man.

00:12:38.068 --> 00:12:39.408
[Students coughing]

00:12:55.428 --> 00:12:56.338
[Bertha] Hey.

00:12:56.338 --> 00:12:57.238
[Martin] Hey.

00:12:57.248 --> 00:12:58.218
Sorry I'm late.

00:12:58.418 --> 00:12:59.838
It's all good.

00:13:00.278 --> 00:13:02.038
You didn't miss much, anyways.

00:13:04.388 --> 00:13:05.888
Where's Ben?

00:13:06.798 --> 00:13:10.728
Apparently he called off sick.
He's filling in.

00:13:11.948 --> 00:13:13.028
[Martin] Gotcha.

00:13:15.148 --> 00:13:18.358
You don't look too
well yourself.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.428
I'm just tired is all.

00:13:21.218 --> 00:13:23.878
I didn't get that much
sleep last night, and

00:13:23.878 --> 00:13:25.728
I was feeling fine until now.

00:13:28.018 --> 00:13:31.518
Hey, well, let's get this done
fast so we can get out of here.

00:13:36.508 --> 00:13:37.318
[Bertha coughing]

00:13:37.328 --> 00:13:38.938
[Bertha coughing]
[Martin] Hey, hey, hey.

00:13:39.258 --> 00:13:41.718
Sit down. You got this, okay?
Take a breath.

00:13:42.188 --> 00:13:42.878
[Bertha] Okay.

00:13:45.858 --> 00:13:49.048
[Other students coughing]

00:14:12.278 --> 00:14:14.558
[Students coughing]

00:14:16.838 --> 00:14:18.488
[Martin] Let's get you
out of here.

00:14:18.998 --> 00:14:20.338
[Bertha] We barely
finished part 2--

00:14:20.338 --> 00:14:21.658
[Martin] No, fuck the experiment. Let's go.

00:14:21.658 --> 00:14:22.418
[Bertha] Okay.

00:14:22.838 --> 00:14:24.718
[Bertha continues coughing]

00:14:24.718 --> 00:14:25.768
[Martin] It's okay.

00:14:28.508 --> 00:14:30.728
Let's get you against
this wall, okay?

00:14:34.038 --> 00:14:35.698
Are you okay?

00:14:37.508 --> 00:14:40.548
Alright... just stay here.

00:14:40.828 --> 00:14:41.878
Help her out.

00:14:46.968 --> 00:14:49.398
[High-pitched tone
increasing in volume]

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:51.518
Hell--

00:14:52.178 --> 00:14:53.128
Fuck!

00:15:10.518 --> 00:15:11.428
Oh my god.

00:15:45.578 --> 00:15:52.628
[Geiger counter clicks]

00:16:51.348 --> 00:16:53.498
[Continued Geiger
counter clicks]

00:18:19.118 --> 00:18:21.158
Status report, Dr. Lafayette?

00:18:21.168 --> 00:18:23.968
Analysis teams are still reporting radiation levels

00:18:23.968 --> 00:18:26.118
over 1,500 millisieverts

00:18:26.118 --> 00:18:28.798
surrounding the anomaly's original location.

00:18:29.208 --> 00:18:30.758
It seems to have stabilized.

00:18:31.658 --> 00:18:33.838
[Lafayette] Luckily, this seems to be only focused on the

00:18:33.838 --> 00:18:35.188
upper floors of the building.

00:18:35.558 --> 00:18:36.548
[Suit] Wonderful.

00:18:36.918 --> 00:18:40.178
No nuclear disaster to
forge a cover-up for.

00:18:41.348 --> 00:18:43.238
What's the status
on the anomaly?

00:18:43.898 --> 00:18:46.508
It's secure, and
poses no threat.

00:18:46.698 --> 00:18:50.278
We've collected every single one of the converted tables as well.

00:18:50.508 --> 00:18:52.148
[Suit] That's good to hear.

00:18:53.028 --> 00:18:54.948
Administration wants this cataloged by

00:18:54.948 --> 00:18:56.658
the end of the week.

00:18:57.668 --> 00:19:00.027
Any word on the state
of the victims?

00:19:00.277 --> 00:19:02.737
Chelation therapy and iodine treatment have stabilized

00:19:02.737 --> 00:19:03.927
most of the victims.

00:19:04.447 --> 00:19:07.547
Although their prognoses are still uncertain.

00:19:07.937 --> 00:19:10.037
How come the victims are
being given medicine for

00:19:10.037 --> 00:19:11.277
heavy metal poisoning?

00:19:11.897 --> 00:19:16.697
I was under the understanding that this anomaly was radioactive in nature.

00:19:17.127 --> 00:19:18.997
That's just our concern, sir.

00:19:19.177 --> 00:19:23.117
We've been picking up high levels of elemental particulates

00:19:23.117 --> 00:19:25.137
and a torrent of other
exotic findings.

00:19:25.797 --> 00:19:27.407
[Suit] The anomalous elements?

00:19:27.687 --> 00:19:28.747
Yes, sir.

00:19:29.127 --> 00:19:32.127
We've been picking up samples of elements the Foundation does not

00:19:32.127 --> 00:19:34.517
have in its periodic catalog,

00:19:34.517 --> 00:19:36.157
even in the extended version.

00:19:36.567 --> 00:19:39.237
Most of the elements have decompressed entirely,

00:19:39.497 --> 00:19:43.367
others are more stubborn, with never-before-seen properties.

00:19:44.067 --> 00:19:45.587
[Suit] God have mercy.

00:19:47.627 --> 00:19:50.167
Be sure to let the administration know.

00:19:50.537 --> 00:19:54.027
I'm sure they don't want another CK Event on their hands.

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:58.967
Have the victims relocated to the ward on Site 14.

00:19:59.187 --> 00:20:01.997
I'll have Dr. Clark
assigned to them.

00:20:02.687 --> 00:20:05.327
I want this place
scrubbed clean.

00:20:05.337 --> 00:20:08.067
Not a trace of anything
left behind.

00:20:09.117 --> 00:20:12.207
Ethics Committee has approved deploying amnestics.

00:20:12.657 --> 00:20:15.297
They'll be in the water supply tomorrow morning.

00:20:15.787 --> 00:20:18.227
You've done a good job,
Dr. Lafayette.

00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:21.347
I'll be sure to let the administration know.

00:20:22.057 --> 00:20:23.687
Thank you, sir.

00:22:19.137 --> 00:22:24.017
